            <h2>We want investing to feel normal, not taboo.</h2>
            <p>
              In Australia, money and investing can still feel a bit awkward.
              A lot of people want to invest but don&apos;t know where to start,
              don&apos;t have time to research everything, or feel like they&apos;re
              the only one who doesn&apos;t “get it”.
            </p>
            <p>
              MatesInvest is here to bridge that gap — to make investing feel
              normal, social and approachable, and to give retail investors tools
              and context that usually live behind professional platforms.

          <p>
            We don&apos;t replace your broker. We sit alongside it — helping you and your mates
            understand what&apos;s going on, why it matters, and how it connects to the holdings
            you already have.

              <h3>1. Connect your existing broker</h3>
              <p>
                Link your ASX account through trusted data partners so you can see your real
                holdings in one simple view. No new brokerage account, no messy CSV uploads.

              <h3>2. Get a clear, no-nonsense brief</h3>
              <p>
                Each morning we pull together market moves, sectors, commodities and key stories
                into a short email and in-app view — all in plain English, with zero jargon.

                We connect the dots for you: which holdings are tied to that move in iron ore,
                how a rate decision might flow through your banks, and where volatility could show up.

                for honest conversation — not anonymous forums or FOMO-driven hype.

              than pushing you to trade more often.
