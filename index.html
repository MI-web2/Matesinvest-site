            <h2>We want investing to feel normal, not taboo.</h2>
            <p>
              In Australia, money and investing can still feel a bit awkward.
              A lot of people want to invest but don&apos;t know where to start,
              don&apos;t have time to research everything, or feel like they&apos;re
              the only one who doesn&apos;t “get it”.
            </p>
            <p>
              MatesInvest is here to bridge that gap — to make investing feel
              normal, social and approachable, and to give retail investors tools
              and context that usually live behind professional platforms.

              We don&apos;t replace your broker. We sit alongside it — helping you and your mates
              understand what&apos;s going on, why it matters, and how it connects to the holdings
              you already have.

                We connect the dots for you: which holdings are tied to that move in iron ore,
                how a rate decision might flow through your banks, and where volatility could show up.
